# ChampComp
The goal of this project is to create an application which intuitively allows users to compare two League of Legends champions
and the damage they are capable of dealing to eachother using live patch data. A completed GUI is present in the MATLAB version 
and demos this user experience. A Python rewrite of the code is in progress, with no completed GUI as of yet. This is primarily
located in the experimental branch under the file "pythonRewrite"
