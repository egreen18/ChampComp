# ChampComp
This project is a work in progress; my end goal is to create a web app that allows for the easy comparison of two champions that can be custom built, with an 
emphasis on calculating how much damage their abilities will do to eachother. When using **DoubleChamp.mlapp**, make sure that all files from the repository are in
same directory. As it stands, your directory will also need to be manually updated in the code on lines **365-368**. Make sure that the string defining your directory
ends with the relevant slash (backslash for windows or forwards slash for mac).
